# University of Pisa Projects

Welcome to my collection of amateur projects developed during my studies at the University of Pisa. This repository serves as a living document of my educational journey and showcases various projects that reflect my learning experience.

## Introduction

Each project within this repository represents a step in my pursuit of mastering the art of software development. While these projects may be amateur in nature, they are crafted with a profound commitment to learning and growth.

## Objective

The primary objective of these projects is to familiarize myself with the principles of managing an open-source project using a Version Control System (VCS), specifically Git in this context. By doing so, I aim to refine my skills and join the ranks of excellence achieved by those who preceded me.

## Inspirational Beginnings

As the celebrated Latin poet Horace once said, "Dimidium facti qui coepit habet," which translates to, "He who has begun is half done." With this ethos, I embark on this open-source journey, starting somewhere, committed to continuous improvement and the pursuit of excellence.

## Projects Overview

Below is a list of projects included in this repository:

- **TicTacToe**: A simple implementation of the classic game to understand the basics of algorithms and user interaction.
- **Data Mining**: An exploration into data analysis and pattern recognition within datasets.
- **ASE Project**: Advanced Software Engineering project work, focusing on design patterns and software architecture.

## Contribution

While this project is personal and not intended for collaboration as mentioned, its primary goal is to enhance my own learning experience. However, I am certainly looking forward to creating a collaborative project in the future where others can contribute. Stay tuned for that, but for now, I'll keep the details under wraps.
