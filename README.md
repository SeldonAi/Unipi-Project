# University of Pisa Projects

Welcome to my collection of projects developed during my studies at the University of Pisa. This repository serves as a living document of my educational journey and showcases various projects that reflect my learning experience.

## Introduction

Each project within this repository represents a step in my pursuit of mastering the art of software development. They are crafted with a profound commitment to learning and growth.

## Objective

The primary objective of these projects is to familiarize myself with the principles of managing an open-source project using a Version Control System (VCS), specifically Git in this context. By doing so, I aim to refine my skills and join the ranks of excellence achieved by those who preceded me.



## Inspirational Beginnings

Embracing the wisdom of the celebrated Latin poet Horace, "Dimidium facti qui coepit habet," I venture into the open-source world, driven by eclectic interests and a curious mind. Starting this journey with the belief that to begin is already half the achievement, I am committed to continuous learning and the pursuit of excellence, always seeking to broaden my understanding across diverse fields.

## Projects Overview
Below is a list of projects included in this repository:

- **Data Mining**: An exploration into data analysis and pattern recognition within datasets.
   - **Clustering and Prediction in the Stock Market: A Quantitative Analysis.** This project focuses on quantitative analysis techniques for stock market prediction and clustering. (It was written in Italian for academic reasons)

- **ASE Project**: Advanced Software Engineering project work, focusing on design patterns and software architecture.
   - **TicTacToe**: A simple implementation of the classic game, exemplifying the basics of algorithms and user interaction as part of the ASE coursework.

## Contribution

While this project is personal and not intended for collaboration as mentioned, its primary goal is to enhance my own learning experience. However, I am certainly looking forward to creating a collaborative project in the future where others can contribute. Stay tuned for that, but for now, I'll keep the details under wraps.
